# Vector Database

This repository contains an implementation of a Vector Database, a specialized database designed for efficient storage and retrieval of high-dimensional vectors. Ideal for applications such as machine learning, similarity search, and data analysis.

## Features

- **Efficient Vector Storage:** Store and manage high-dimensional vectors in a space-efficient manner.
- **Fast Retrieval:** Implement efficient algorithms for retrieving vectors based on similarity search.
- **Scalability:** Design the database to scale seamlessly as the volume of vectors increases.
- **Customizable:** Easily adapt the database implementation to specific use cases and requirements.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/Vector-Database.git
    cd Vector-Database
    ```

2. Explore the implementation and review the documentation for usage instructions.

## Usage

```python
python main.py
```
