        "context": "INTRODUCTIONThe human body is an excellent culture vessel,  providing nutrients and a hospitable environment that support the growth of countless microbes. Collectively,  these microbial species constitute the human microbiota. Nearly 500 years ago,  Leeuwenhoek observed these tiny 'animalcules' under his microscope and recorded the great diversity in cell size and shape in human dental plaque. In recent years,  researchers have begun using marker gene surveys to catalog the species that colonize different regions of our bodies,  including the oral cavity. These studies have primarily used high-throughput sequencing of the highly conserved rRNA gene to identify and quantify the numerous species constituting the microbiota. Among the best-characterized human-associated microbial communities are the extremely diverse gut and oral microbiota. It is now appreciated that our indigenous microbiota are tightly linked to health. Studies using germfree mice have shown that key members of the microbiota promote normal immune system development. However,  several human diseases,  including diabetes,  Crohn's disease,  and periodontitis,  are linked to disruptions in the gut and oral microbial populations. In light of these results,  microbiota-associated diseases such as periodontitis are increasingly examined through an ecological lens."

Lastly,  the MD-index was also significantly higher in those patients positive for two or more microbial or cytokine serological markers (p < 0.0001,  Student's t-test). Since serologic markers are increasingly being used to help differentiate IBD disease phenotypes,  such an association might indicate a potential link between the gut microbial biomarkers and the presence of these serologic biomarkers. However,  with the data collected for this cohort,  no specific correlations were found."

        "context": "Shotgun metagenome-based identification of microbial biomarkers Most published studies of the microbiome in IBD so far have used a 16S rRNA gene-based approach,  and are thereby limited in characterizing the microbiota to a resolution at the family/genus level. To study the microbiota at a higher resolution,  a subset of 43 stool samples (10 controls and 33 subjects) were shotgun-sequenced for metagenomics using the Illumina HiSeq2000 platform (mean 13.3 gigabases (Gb) and s.d. 2.5 Gb per sample,  paired-end reads,  fragment insert size 180b). Metagenomic data were filtered for human and low-quality reads,  and further analyzed as described in Experimental Procedures. As indicated above,  the stool samples of patients do not reflect the dysbiosis in a similar way as the mucosal tissue samples,  a finding that we confirmed at both the taxonomic and functional levels with these data (results not shown). Nevertheless,  mucosal-associated organisms were not restricted to any particular intestinal location,  and were readily observed in all sample types,  although at lower abundances. Therefore,  by adding metagenomics data on the subset of stool samples,  we were able to profile the composition of microbial communities at a finer taxonomic resolution (Table S2F).

Unsupervised hierarchical clustering of crOTU abundances within the gut and oral microbiomes was then performed without input of response data. We found that patients segregated into 2 distinct community types. Type 1 comprised entirely of R and was enriched for Clostridiales,  whereas Type 2 comprised a mixture of R and NR (p=0.02) and was enriched for Bacteroidales (Fig. 3A). To better understand compositional differences between these crOTU community types,  we again performed pairwise comparisons of the gut microbiota,  and identified a pattern very similar to that seen when clustering by response,  with Clostridiales/Ruminococcaceae enriched in Type 1,  and Bacteroidales enriched in Type 2 (fig. S14A and table S5). Further,  these communities clustered distinctly using principal coordinate analysis of weighted Unifrac distances (fig. S14B). Analysis of crOTUs in the oral microbiome revealed no apparent relationship to treatment response (fig. S15,  A and B). To explore how specific bacterial taxa impact patient treatment response,  we compared PFS following anti-PD-1 therapy as it related to the 'top hits' consistently observed across our analyses. From the Ruminococcaceae family of the Clostridiales order,  we focused on the Faecalibacterium genus in R,  and Bacteroidales order in NR,  and stratified patients into high versus low categories based on the median relative abundance of these taxa in the gut microbiome.

We propose that patients with a 'favorable' gut microbiome (e.g.,  high diversity and abundance of Ruminococcaceae/Faecalibacterium) have enhanced systemic and anti-tumor immune responses mediated by increased antigen presentation,  and improved effector T cell function in the periphery and the tumor microenvironment. In contrast,  patients with an 'unfavorable' gut microbiome (e.g.,  low diversity and high relative abundance of Bacteroidales) have impaired systemic and anti-tumor immune responses mediated by limited intratumoral lymphoid and myeloid infiltration and weakened antigen presentation capacity. These findings highlight the therapeutic potential of modulating the gut microbiome in patients receiving checkpoint blockade immunotherapy,  and warrant prompt evaluation in cancer patients through clinical trials."

Rarefaction analyses suggested that operational taxonomic units (OTUs,  species-level) richness decreased in COPD. The dominant taxa between COPD and controls were similar,  but the proportions of taxonomic distribution were different. The dominant phyla were Bacteroidetes,  Proteobacteria,  Firmicutes and Fusobacteria. The dominant genera were Haemophilus,  Leptotrichia,  Porphyromonas,  Fusobacterium,  Veillonella,  Streptococcus,  Neisseria and Prevotella.

        "context": "animalis was completely different from that of all of the other fusobacterial species and subspecies identified,  with a striking almost exclusive colonization of denture surfaces in stomatitis patients (Fig. 4A). This particular subspecies of F. nucleatum has been identified as an etiological agent in a case report connecting the oral microbiota with stillbirth,  documented to be more prevalent in subgingival plaque and early periodontitis,  as well as experimental gingivitis. Furthermore,  F. nucleatum subsp. animalis is part of the microbial signature in early detection of colorectal cancer and the only fusobacterial species/subspecies found to overlap between the microorganisms isolated from the periodontal pocket and the atheromatous plaque in cardiac disease patients. Our finding of a strong association of F. nucleatum subsp. animalis with the inflammatory mucosal condition stomatitis in combination with the above findings by other research groups suggests that this F. nucleatum subspecies may be more pathogenic than others."

        "answer": "Analyzing microbial colonization beyond the genus or phylum level provides a more differentiated understanding of the distribution patterns and associations with health and disease.",
        "context": "As already discussed above,  the different representatives of the genus Fusobacterium present in our samples displayed a distinct surface and denture health status-dependent distribution (Fig. 4A). Our finding that Porphyromonas,  a genus typically associated with disease,  exhibited a significant surface-independent health association (see Fig. S4A) provides an example of how the lack of taxonomic resolution could influence results and data interpretation. Phylotype level examination revealed that the genus Porphyromonas was predominantly represented in our samples by Porphyromonas sp. strain HOT-279,  a phylotype that is abundant in healthy human subjects who participated in the Human Microbiome Project. Additional,  less abundant representatives of Porphyromonas (P. gingivalis,  P. endodontalis,  P. catoniae,  and Porphyromonas sp. strain HOT-275) exhibited the \"typical\" disease association of this genus,  as they were significantly correlated with the remaining dentition of stomatitis patients (see Fig. S4A). Since these distinct health- and disease-associated distribution patterns of individual representatives of certain genera are apparent only on the phylotype/species level,  genus level microbiome analysis is not always sufficient to provide a comprehensive picture of the relevant players and higher-resolution analyses could be critical for in-depth understanding of the oral microbiome in health and disease."

        "answer": "Celiac disease (CD) is a chronic immune-mediated enteropathy induced by dietary gluten in genetically predisposed individuals.",
        "context": "Celiac disease (CD) is a chronic immune-mediated enteropathy induced by dietary gluten in genetically predisposed individuals. Saliva harbors the second highest bacterial load of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract after the colon. We hypothesized that enzymes produced by oral bacteria may be involved in gluten processing in the intestine and susceptibility to celiac disease. The aim of this study was to investigate salivary enzymatic activities and oral microbial profiles in healthy subjects versus patients with classical and refractory CD. Stimulated whole saliva was collected from patients with CD in remission (n = 21) and refractory CD (RCD; n = 8) and was compared to healthy controls (HC; n = 20) and subjects with functional GI complaints (n = 12). Salivary gluten-degrading activities were monitored with the tripeptide substrate Z-Tyr-Pro-Gln-pNA and the \u03b1-gliadin-derived immunogenic 33-mer peptide. The oral microbiome was profiled by 16S rRNA-based MiSeq analysis. Salivary glutenase activities were higher in CD patients compared to controls,  both before and after normalization for protein concentration or bacterial load. The oral microbiomes of CD and RCD patients showed significant differences from that of healthy subjects,  e.g.,  higher salivary levels of lactobacilli (P < 0.05),  which may partly explain the observed higher gluten-degrading activities. While the pathophysiological link between the oral and gut microbiomes in CD needs further exploration,  the presented data suggest that oral microbe-derived enzyme activities are elevated in subjects with CD,  which may impact gluten processing and the presentation of immunogenic gluten epitopes to the immune system in the small intestine. IMPORTANCE Ingested gluten proteins are the triggers of intestinal inflammation in celiac disease (CD). Certain immunogenic gluten domains are resistant to intestinal proteases but can be hydrolyzed by oral microbial enzymes. Very little is known about the endogenous proteolytic processing of gluten proteins in the oral cavity. Given that this occurs prior to gluten reaching the small intestine,  such enzymes are likely to contribute to the composition of the gluten digest that ultimately reaches the small intestine and causes CD. We demonstrated that endogenous salivary protease activities are incomplete,  likely liberating peptides from larger gluten proteins. The potentially responsible microbes were identified. The study included refractory CD patients,  who have been studied less with regard to CD pathogenesis."

Group B as well as Group A Streptococci have been linked to neurodegeneration as well as specific neurologic conditions. Neurotoxicity of Group B Streptococci and S. pneumoniae seem to be mediated by nitric oxide production through effects on microglia and astrocytes. Although it is unclear from the present work whether bacteria may have a local effect at the optic nerve head we have previously shown that lipopolysaccharide (LPS) treatment induces specific changes in microglia and the TLR4 pathway in the optic nerve and retina. The results of that work suggest that localization of bacteria in these CNS structures is not necessary (as for example has been observed in atheromatous plaques) to induce inflammatory responses. In fact such localization has not been reported and is rather unlikely. Given the increased permeability of optic nerve head capillaries it is likely that bacterial products (rather than intact bacteria) can come in contact with resident microglia in this region to initiate or enhance a local inflammatory response that can lead to axonal neurodegeneration."

        "context": "It is unclear whether differences in prevalence of rarer species identified in this cohort represent real differences between the glaucoma cases and non-glaucomatous control populations. Given the low prevalence of these species,  these results should be viewed with caution until confirmed in larger samples.Finally,  it is important to point out that the total amount of oral bacterial loads were not correlated with disease severity among cases,  and while a number of genera did correlate with disease severity streptococcal loads did not correlate with it. This finding implies that a threshold of Streptococci may be necessary to prime glaucomatous neurodegeneration,  but that it may not be needed to sustain this process."

        "context": "Gut dysbiosis worsens SS-like disease in mice SS affects multiple mucosal tissues and their supporting glands. Because secretory dysfunction of these glands results in reduced levels of growth factors and innate antimicrobial factors,  we hypothesized this could result in mucosal microbial dysbiosis. We evaluated the effects of antibiotic (ABX) treatment on severity of ocular disease in a validated mouse dry eye model with features of SS. This model is induced by pharmacological suppression of glandular tear secretion by cholinergic blockade and exposure to a desiccating stress (DS) environment (drafty and <30% relative humidity). Mice develop severe keratoconjunctivitis sicca with features resembling SS,  including corneal barrier disruption,  loss of conjunctival goblet cells,  and increased expression of inflammatory and T-cell related cytokines in the conjunctiva in response to DS. Our experimental design is presented in Fig. 1A. The effects of our standard DS model on the intestinal microbiome were evaluated by 16S rRNA gene sequencing of stools collected from the same group of mice prior to (non-stressed; NS) and after DS for 5 or 10 days. Mice drank regular water for the duration of the experiment. There was an increase in observed operational taxonomic units (OTUs,  P = 0.013,  data not shown) and Shannon diversity index at DS10 compared to NS control mice (P = 0.02; Kruskall-Wallis with false-discovery rate (FDR) correction,  data not shown). Next we performed UniFrac analysis,  which measures dissimilarity between microbial communities accounting for phylogenetic distance and permutational multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA) using distance matrices which detects genetic differences in populations. Clustering was observed among these groups by unweighted UniFrac principal coordinate analysis (P = 0.006,  PERMANOVA,  data not shown). There was a small shift in the relative abundance of phyla in Proteobacteria in the DS group after 5 days of treatment (4.48 to 7.61%,  DS5; P < 0.05; Kruskall-Wallis with FDR correction) and in DS10 compared to NS mice (4.48 vs. 11.94%,  P < 0.05; Kruskall-Wallis with FDR correction; data not shown). We repeated the same protocol using mice that received a cocktail of oral antibiotics (Ampicillin,  Gentamicin,  Metronidazole,  Neomycin,  Vancomycin) for 14 days prior to (baseline) and during the 5 (ABX + DS5) or 10-day (ABX + DS10) exposure to DS. Stool pellets were collected from the same group of mice at baseline and after 5 and 10 days of DS and were processed in the same manner as above. The total duration of antibiotic treatment was 24 days. A significantly lower number of OTUs in ABX + DS10 group compared to baseline was observed and this was accompanied by lower Shannon diversity index (P < 0.0001 for both,  Fig. 1B; Kruskall-Wallis with FDR correction). PERMANOVA of unweighted UniFrac metrics demonstrated significant differences in community composition between baseline,  ABX + DS5 and ABX + DS10 groups (P = 0.001,  R2 = 0.0631,  Fig. 1C). We observed that the most abundant phyla showed a progressive and significant decrease in ABX + DS groups (Bacteroidetes: 54.21% vs. 6.51% vs. 0.65%; Firmicutes: 42.63% vs. 15.97% vs. 3.41% in baseline,  ABX + DS5 and ABS + DS10,  respectively,  P < 0.0001 for all; Kruskall-Wallis with FDR correction),  while Proteobacteria bloomed (1.66 vs. 59.39 vs. 81.88% baseline,  ABX + DS5 and ABS + DS10,  respectively,  P < 0.001; Kruskall-Wallis with FDR correction)."

        "context": " in this large study of the human oral microbiome,  we observed that smoking is related to overall oral microbiome community composition,  and to the abundance of many taxa. Smoking may promote an anaerobic oral environment and a bacterial community with reduced xenobiotic degradation capabilities. Strengths of this study include the large sample size,  the ability to check replication of findings in four data sets and the control of potential confounders. This study was limited by lack of metagenomic data to determine the actual gene content of bacteria altered by smoking and lack of longitudinal samples pre- and post-smoking cessation. Additionally,  due to the elderly age of our study participants,  our findings may not be generalizable to younger populations,  particularly since the oral microbiome changes with age (Xu et al.,  2015). Future studies should investigate the impact of smoking on the metagenomic content of the oral microbiome,  and whether smoking-related oral bacterial and/or metagenomic changes mediate the health effects of smoking. Oral microbiome dysbiosis is associated with oral disease and potentially with systemic diseases; however,  the determinants of these microbial imbalances are largely unknown. In a study of 1204 US adults,  we assessed the relationship of cigarette smoking with the oral microbiome. 16S rRNA gene sequencing was performed on DNA from oral wash samples,  sequences were clustered into operational taxonomic units (OTUs) using QIIME and metagenomic content was inferred using PICRUSt. Overall oral microbiome composition differed between current and non-current (former and never) smokers (P<0.001). Current smokers had lower relative abundance of the phylum Proteobacteria (4.6%) compared with never smokers (11.7%) (false discovery rate q=5.2 × 10(-7)),  with no difference between former and never smokers; the depletion of Proteobacteria in current smokers was also observed at class,  genus and OTU levels. Taxa not belonging to Proteobacteria were also associated with smoking: the genera Capnocytophaga,  Peptostreptococcus and Leptotrichia were depleted,  while Atopobium and Streptococcus were enriched,  in current compared with never smokers. Functional analysis from inferred metagenomes showed that bacterial genera depleted by smoking were related to carbohydrate and energy metabolism,  and to xenobiotic metabolism. Our findings demonstrate that smoking alters the oral microbiome,  potentially leading to shifts in functional pathways with implications for smoking-related diseases."

        "answer": "The long-term effects of smoking-related oral dysbiosis remain unclear at this time,  but oral bacteria are known to play an important role in both oral and systemic diseases. Changes in the oral bacterial community due to smoking may have detrimental health effects.",
        "context": "These chemicals are components of cigarette smoke (Rodgman and Perfetti,  2013),  and thus alterations in the ability of the oral community to degrade these substances may have toxic consequences for the host. It is surprising that some of the xenobiotic degradation pathways are depleted in smokers,  given the need for bacterial upregulation of these pathways to detoxify cigarette smoke. This result is also in contrast with a metagenomic study which observed increased cytochrome P450 xenobiotic metabolism in smokers (Boyle et al.,  2010). A simple explanation for our finding is that these pathways are carried out in bacteria that were depleted in smokers. Alternatively,  the toxic compounds themselves may saturate the enzymes responsible for their degradation,  thus killing the bacteria possessing these enzymes. Although the long-term effects of smoking-related oral dysbiosis remain unclear at this time,  oral bacteria are known to play an important role in both oral and systemic diseases (Wade,  2013; Olsen,  2015). It is therefore not unreasonable to imagine that changes in the oral bacterial community due to smoking may have detrimental health effects."

    {
        "question": "Can the oral bacterial community be restored following smoking cessation?",
        "answer": "Oral bacteria abundances were generally similar between former and never smokers,  implying that specific bacteria depleted by smoking may be restored following smoking cessation. However,  a small number of bacteria were still found to be differentially abundant in former smokers compared to never smokers,  indicating some minor lingering effects of smoking.",
        "context": "We additionally observed that oral bacteria abundances were generally similar between former and never smokers,  implying that specific bacteria depleted by smoking may be restored following smoking cessation. Interestingly,  a small number of OTUs were identified as differentially abundant between former and never smokers,  including a few that were altered in the same direction as in current smokers. This finding may indicate some minor lingering effects of smoking. We did not observe an association between years since smoking cessation and bacterial class relative abundances in analyses restricted to former smokers. The absence of a clear trend with years since quitting among former smokers may be due to restoration of the oral microbiome occurring relatively quickly following smoking cessation,  for example,  during the first year or two immediately after quitting. We had insufficient data on the precise timing of smoking cessation to examine potential trends in oral microbiome composition during the period within a few years of quitting. Moreover,  the effect of smoking cessation on the oral microbiome would be better studied with longitudinally collected oral wash samples,  which would allow for within-person comparison of the oral microbiome pre- and post-smoking cessation. A few studies have examined the effect of smoking cessation on subgingival plaque bacteria longitudinally (Fullmer et al.,  2009; Delima et al.,  2010); however,  these studies were limited by the extent of bacterial profiling. A longitudinal investigation of smoking cessation involving more extensive bacterial profiling of the oral microbiome (i.e. 16S rRNA gene sequencing) will be important to determine which taxa recolonize the oral environment after smoking cessation."

        "context": "Dental caries is one of the most common diseases worldwide. Bacteria and fungi are both commensals in the oral cavity; however,  most research regarding caries has focused on bacterial impacts. The oral fungal mycobiome associated with caries is not well characterized,  and its role in disease is unclear. ITS1 amplicon sequencing was used to generate taxonomic profiles from site-specific supragingival plaque samples (n=82) obtained from 33 children with different caries status. Children were either caries free (CF),  caries active with enamel lesions (CAE),  or caries active with dentin lesions (CA). Plaque samples were collected from caries-free surfaces (PF) and from enamel (PE) and dentin (PD) lesions. Taxonomic profiles representing the different categorizations (CF-PF,  CAE-PF,  CAE-PE,  CA-PF,  CA-PE,  and CA-PD) were used to characterize the mycobiome and its change through disease progression. A total of 139 fungal species were identified. Candida albicans was the most abundant species,  followed by Candida dubliniensis. We found that severely progressed plaque communities (CA-PD) were significantly different from healthy plaque communities (CF-PF). A total of 32 taxa were differentially abundant across the plaque categories. C. albicans,  C. dubliniensis,  Nigrospora oryzae,  and an unclassified Microdochium sp. were correlated with caries,  whereas 12 other taxa were correlated with health. C. dubliniensis increased steadily as caries progressed,  suggesting that C. dubliniensis may play an important role in caries pathogenicity. In contrast,  four health-associated fungal taxa have the potential to antagonize the cariogen Streptococcus mutans via xylitol production,  suggesting a possible fungal mechanism that could contribute to maintenance of dental health. IMPORTANCE Early-childhood caries is one of the most prevalent diseases in children worldwide and,  while preventable,  remains a global public health concern. Untreated cavities are painful and expensive and can lead to tooth loss and a lower quality of life. Caries are driven by acid production via microbial fermentation of dietary carbohydrates,  resulting in enamel erosion. While caries is a well-studied disease,  most research has focused on bacterial impacts,  even though fungi are commensal organisms living within the plaque biofilm. There is very little known about how fungi impact caries pathogenicity. The elucidation of fungal taxa involved in caries disease progression is necessary for a more holistic view of the human oral microbiome. Data from this study will improve our understanding of how the fungal community changes as disease progresses and provide insight into the complex etiology of dental caries,  which is necessary for the development of treatment plans and preventative measures."

        "context": " Human microbiomes are predicted to assemble in a reproducible and ordered manner yet there is limited knowledge on the development of the complex bacterial communities that constitute the oral microbiome. The oral microbiome plays major roles in many oral diseases including early childhood caries (ECC),  which afflicts up to 70% of children in some countries. Saliva contains oral bacteria that are indicative of the whole oral microbiome and may have the ability to reflect the dysbiosis in supragingival plaque communities that initiates the clinical manifestations of ECC. The aim of this study was to determine the assembly of the oral microbiome during the first four years of life and compare it with the clinical development of ECC. The oral microbiomes of 134 children enrolled in a birth cohort study were determined at six ages between two months and four years-of-age and their mother's oral microbiome was determined at a single time point. We identified and quantified 356 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) of bacteria in saliva by sequencing the V4 region of the bacterial 16S RNA genes. Bacterial alpha diversity increased from a mean of 31 OTUs in the saliva of infants at 1.9 months-of-age to 84 OTUs at 39 months-of-age. The oral microbiome showed a distinct shift in composition as the children matured. The microbiome data were compared with the clinical development of ECC in the cohort at 39,  48,  and 60 months-of-age as determined by ICDAS-II assessment. Streptococcus mutans was the most discriminatory oral bacterial species between health and current disease,  with an increased abundance in disease. Overall our study demonstrates an ordered temporal development of the oral microbiome,  describes a limited core oral microbiome and indicates that saliva testing of infants may help predict ECC risk. IntroductionEarly Childhood Caries (ECC) is a complex,  multifaceted disease involving interactions between the oral microbiota,  host susceptibility at the tooth,  mouth and person level,  and environmental factors,  especially behaviours relating to early feeding practices,  ingestion of free sugars and oral hygiene. ECC is defined as the presence of one or more decayed (non-cavitated or cavitated lesions),  missing (due to caries),  or filled tooth surfaces (dmfs) in any primary tooth in a child under the age of six years. Australian children at four years of age have an average decayed,  missing,  and filled teeth (dmft) score of 1.94. However,  this score masks the true pattern and burden of disease as 60% of those examined were caries free. Additionally,  the burden of disease associated with ECC is disproportionately borne by children from vulnerable and disadvantaged families.Although largely preventable ECC can be difficult to diagnose in its early stages. Cavitation is a late stage of the disease process that initially manifests as a change in the species composition of the supragingival plaque microbiota from the commensal plaque biofilm community to a dysbiotic community that is dominated by acidogenic and aciduric species. Although S. mutans and to a lesser degree S. sobrinus have historically been linked to dental caries initiation recent microbiome-based studies have implicated a much wider range of other acidogenic and aciduric bacterial species,  including other streptococci,  Actinomyces spp. and bifidobacteria such as Scardovia wiggsiae with disease. The abundance of a number of these species in supragingival plaque has been associated with caries activity in cross-sectional studies. Detection of the change in composition of the supragingival plaque microbiota is therefore a method to detect ECC-risk prior to clinical manifestation of caries and offers the opportunity to treat caries at its earliest stages preventing irreversible cavitation.The bacterial aetiology of ECC is further complicated by the fact that bacteria are colonising the child's oral cavity at a time when teeth are erupting and are vulnerable to demineralization. We currently have limited information on the timing of the colonisation of human oral cavity by bacteria and the development of the oral microbiome in infants. Saliva is an easily obtained bodily fluid that contains a significant number of detectable oral bacterial species that have the potential to act as biomarkers for the bacterial dysbiosis in supragingival plaque that leads to clinical caries manifestation. The bacterial composition of saliva,  whilst over representing those bacteria present on the mucosal surfaces of the oral cavity,  especially the tongue and buccal epithelium,  has been routinely used to describe the oral microbiome"

By analysing biofilm samples from patients with oral health and patients with severe tooth decay we aimed at further describing 'Who is there?' Furthermore,  it was our interest to investigate how the clinical and epidemiological parameters relate to microbiome composition. We found that the healthy microbiome displayed stable and repetitive character compared with the diseased ones. The healthy core community was dominated by Fusobacteria,  Veillonella,  Streptococcus spp.,  Haemophilus parainfluenzae,  Campylobacter gracilis,  Neisseria unclassified,  Capnocytophaga leadbetteri,  Corynebacteriuim matruchotii,  Prevotella melaninogenica,  Prevotella oris,  and thus confirms literature data. These bacteria,  and Actinomyces as well were already shown to be relatively constant and abundant within and between individuals. In this study,  the health associated core microbiome was higher in alpha diversity. Conflicting data exists on this parameter in concordant studies,  but also in deviant ones. Clearly,  species richness is high in a healthy oral environment and narrows down to few out-competing pathogens in the course of a disease. In caries,  the degree of dominance of pathogens,  however,  does not only depend on the extent of the disease but also on environmental factors during disease progression."

        "context": "In the present investigation,  deep dentin lesions showed higher dominance,  less diversity (Figs 3 and 4),  and a set of carious associated bacteria where Streptococcus mutans played a role of only minor importance (Fig 7). Eriksson et al. have tried to classify Streptococcus mutans with the presence of accompanying bacterial species in a kind of Streptococcus mutans abundance model. Low Streptococcus mutans was associated with the presence of Propionibacterium propionicum. Propionibacteria are found at many sites of the human body,  also in the mouth. There they seem to be associated with dentin caries,  especially Propionibacterium propionicum and Propionibacterium acidifaciens. This seems plausible since Propionibacteria are Gram-positive,  anaerobic and generally producing lactic acid,  propionic acid,  and acetic acid from glucose. The fact that they are proteolytic and co-aggregating with Lactobacillus species gives them a competitive advantage in deep lesions where the glucose supply is limited and proteins are more frequently available by collagen degradation. In the present data set Streptococcus mutans is only moderately overabundant whereas Propionibacterium acidifaciens and diverse Lactobacillus species are the dominating species. Referring to the model of Eriksson et al.,  we seem to have the predominantly low Streptococcus mutans-high Propionibacterium (and Lactobacillus) pattern. Obata et al. also found that in their caries samples of 32 Japanese patients aged 4-76 years more than half of the mean bacterial distributions of bacterial genera in carious dentin were Lactobacillus and Propionibacterium. What was also notable in this study was that the main species of the genus Propionibacterium was Propionibacterium acidifaciens."

Despite a scarcity of data,  the antifungal treatment of OLP patients has been shown to improve the clinical symptoms of OLP. Another study also described the involvement of fungi in the aggravation of inflammatory responses and the severity of gastrointestinal diseases. Based on the correlation between the myco-bacteriome and clinical parameters observed in this study and in a previous investigation,  we suggest that the mycobiome may interact with commensal bacteria to augment the mucosal inflammatory response. In contrast,  cytokines IL-17 had been shown to influence fungal composition and are important for protecting against infections caused by fungi (C. albicans,  Aspergillus fumigatus,  and P. carinii) on mucosal surfaces through the release of proinflammatory cytokines,  chemokines,  and anti-microbial peptides. A functional deficiency in the Th17 cell subset is associated with a dysbiotic state characterized by Candida overgrowth. Furthermore,  signalling through the IL-17 receptor is crucial for protecting against candidiasis. The results of these studies demonstrated that IL-17 can play a central role on influencing the composition of core fungi,  such as Candida and Aspergillus.

Thus,  it is possible that the changes we and other groups have seen may reflect a compensatory mechanism in the GI tract. However,  while Lactobacilli are also generally considered probiotic,  some members of the Lactobacillaceae family may exert a disease-worsening effect in PD. Specifically,  Lactobacillus reuteri,  which we found significantly increased in our PD subjects,  was shown in a prior study to increase alpha-synuclein release in cultured ENS neurons,  presumably due to increased firing of mesenteric afferent nerve bundles (caused by decreasing calcium-dependent potassium channel opening and reducing the slow afterhyperpolarization in these neurons).

        "context": "While investigation of the microbiome on natural oral surfaces has generated a wealth of information,  few studies have examined the microbial communities colonizing dentures and their relationship to oral health. To address this knowledge gap,  we characterized the bacterial community associated with dentures and remaining teeth in healthy individuals and patients with denture stomatitis. The microbiome compositions of matched denture and tooth plaque samples of 10 healthy individuals and 9 stomatitis patients were determined by 16S rRNA gene pyrosequencing. The microbial communities colonizing dentures and remaining teeth in health and disease were very similar to each other. Matched denture and tooth samples from the same individuals shared a significantly higher percentage of identical phylotypes than random pairs of samples from different study participants. Despite these overall similarities,  several bacterial phylotypes displayed discrete health- and stomatitis-associated denture colonization,  while others were distinct in health and disease independently of the surface. Certain phylotypes exhibited differential colonization of dentures and teeth independently of denture health status. denture and natural tooth surfaces in health and stomatitis harbor similar bacterial communities. Individual-related rather than surface-specific factors play a significant role in the bacterial phylotype composition colonizing dentures and teeth. This individual-specific mutual influence on denture and tooth surface colonization could be an important factor in maintaining oral health in denture wearers. Discrete differences in colonization patterns for distinct genera and phylotypes warrant further studies regarding their potential involvement or utility as specific indicators of health and disease development in denture-wearing individuals."

Despite the fact that microorganisms are the obvious suspects for most of the above denture-related diseases,  little is known about their etiology. Most studies investigating denture-associated microorganisms focus on colonization with Candida sp.,  which is considered an important etiological agent for denture stomatitis,  even though bacterial species have been implicated in this oral disease as well.

Furthermore,  F. nucleatum subsp. animalis is part of the microbial signature in early detection of colorectal cancer and the only fusobacterial species/subspecies found to overlap between the microorganisms isolated from the periodontal pocket and the atheromatous plaque in cardiac disease patients. Our finding of a strong association of F. nucleatum subsp. animalis with the inflammatory mucosal condition stomatitis in combination with the above findings by other research groups suggests that this F. nucleatum subspecies may be more pathogenic than others."

Most species in Neisseria and Haemophilus genera only mildly ferment sugar and exhibit a low acid resistance. As a non-caries-associated species,  for instance,  Neisseria subflava cannot be cultured in the environment where pH is lower than 4.5.

        "context": "The similarity in richness of the two groups can be attributed to the lower evenness in degree in the pSS group; the results of Pielou analysis confirmed that hypothesis. Despite the disease itself,  the huge variation in saliva flow is one of the explanations of the significantly reduced microbial diversity in pSS patients. The saliva maintains a balanced homoeostasis between the highly diverse oral microbiome and oral health status by various mechanisms,  such as MUC5B (one of the mucoprotein that is encoded by the MUC5B gene),  lysozyme,  histatins,  beta-defensins and the human cathelicidin LL37.

        "context": "Another study described a pronounced increase of Streptococcus and Veillonella in pSS patients with normal salivation,  which emphasizes that the disturbance in the biocoenosis of pSS patients can occur independent of hyposalivation. In a study of dental and salivary micro-organisms of individuals with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) launched by Zhang et al.,  reductions of Haemophilus spp.,  Porphyromonas gingivalis and Rothia aeria were observed in the oral cavities of RA patients. SSA (Sjogren's syndrome Antigen A)/Ro60 is a major autoantigen in SS and SLE. A recent study with laboratory research revealed that the von Willebrand factor type A (vWFA) domain protein produced by Capnocytophaga ochracea was the most potent activator of SSA; further,  SSA/Ro60-reactive T cells were activated by recombinant vWFA protein. These results demonstrate that the autoimMune responses to the normal human microbes and opportunistic pathogens might be the potential trigger of initial autoimmunity in SS and SLE. These observations emphasize that there is change in the oral microbial diversity of patients affected by the disease itself and by medication; inversely,  the human microbiota conditions the individual's autoimmunity,  which has a strong relationship with hereditary susceptibility. Given the complex and unclear interaction between the oral microbiota and autoimMune diseases,  this merits further exploration."

        "context": "The reason remains elusive,  although it is conceivable that a long-lasting presence of undigested gluten peptides in the gut lumen may select those species with a high capability of degrading them. On the other hand,  the depletion of this species in PCD might contribute to loss of gluten tolerance since an incomplete digestion generates oligopeptides with high immunogenicity. Finally,  in the salivary ecosystem,  it emerges that the SR1 phylum rises from a rate of less than 1% in controls and refractory patients to about 5% in PCD,  ACD,  and TCD. This is a relatively recently described phylum,  of which the abundance increases in the oral cavity of subjects with periodontal disease."

Here we show the dysbiotic oral microbial ecology in e-cigarette users influencing the local host immune environment compared with non-smoker controls and cigarette smokers. Using 16S rRNA high-throughput sequencing,  we evaluated 119 human participants,  40 in each of the three cohorts,  and found significantly altered beta-diversity in e-cigarette users (p = 0.006) when compared with never smokers or tobacco cigarette smokers. The abundance of Porphyromonas and Veillonella (p = 0.008) was higher among vapers. Interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-1beta were highly elevated in e-cigarette users when compared with non-users. Epithelial cell-exposed e-cigarette aerosols were more susceptible for infection. In vitro infection model of premalignant Leuk-1 and malignant cell lines exposed to e-cigarette aerosol and challenged by Porphyromonas gingivalis and Fusobacterium nucleatum resulted in elevated inflammatory response. Our findings for the first time demonstrate that e-cigarette users are more prone to infection.Graphical AbstractHighlightsE- cigarette vapors contain high nicotine concentration and other toxic compoundsE-cigarette modulates oral microbiome and increases the abundance of oral pathobiontsE-cigarette aerosol alters host response and promotes gum inflammationE-cigarette aerosol exposure makes epithelial cells susceptible to infectionIn Vitro Toxicology; Microbiome; Oral Microbiology IntroductionElectronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes),  non-combustible battery-operated devices,  are considered to be a safe and healthier alternative to conventional combustible cigarette smoke. However,  according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC),  the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA),  and the National Cancer Institute analysis of the 2011-2018 National Youth Tobacco Surveys data,  to estimate tobacco product use in US middle and high school students,  it was reported that in 2018,  the current use of any tobacco product was 27.1% in high school students (4.04 million) and 7.2% in middle school students (840, 000); e-cigarettes were the most commonly used product among high school (20.8%; 3.05 million) and middle school (4.9%; 570, 000) students. Interestingly,  e-cigarette vaping swelled by 77.8% (from 11.7% to 20.8%) among high school students and 48.5% (from 3.3% to 4.9%) among middle school students in the year 2017-2018. These figures are of great concern due to the mounting popularity of e-cigarette usage among teenagers having never smoked any combustible products.Unlike traditional cigarettes with tobacco filling,  which approximates 24 mg of nicotine per pack (1.2 mg/cigarette),  e-cigarette liquid contains nicotine that varies between 6 and 48 mg/mL and is not meant to be smoked completely in one sitting. Each nicotine cartridge in an e-cigarette can provide on an average 200 puffs equivalent to one to three packs of cigarettes. The nicotine absorption in the body from e-cigarette use depends on the nicotine concentration in the e-liquid,  its aerosol mass quantity and deposition,  the chemical form of the nicotine,  as well as the vaping volume,  frequency,  and timing. As per a 2014 report,  the US FDA detected in one of the cartridges the presence of diethylene glycol,  a toxic liquid used in explosives and as an antifreeze agent,  in addition to,  cancer-causing agents,  such as tobacco-specific nitrosamines,  aldehydes,  metals,  volatile organic compounds,  phenolic compounds,  polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons,  flavors,  solvent carriers,  tobacco alkaloids,  and drugs (amino tadalafil and rimonabant). Moreover,  recent studies showed that nicotine delivery and emission of some toxicant levels from the latest generation of e-cigarettes were comparable to those from tobacco smoke.The oral cavity is a gateway and a permanent or makeshift harbor for numerous microbial species to colonize the respiratory and gastrointestinal (GI) tracts. The multifactorial pathogenicity of chronic periodontal disease involves a complex interaction of microbial pathogens,  host immune response,  and genetic and environmental factors,  stimulating the host tissue destruction and bone loss. Certain oral bacteria,  Porphyromonas gingivalis and Fusobacterium nucleatum,  are major perpetrators in periodontal destruction,  highly associated with disease progression. The release of host immune mediators as a primary response to these opportunistic pathogens (pathobionts) and its metabolites favors the disease state. The dysbiosis in microbial communities due to impaired homeostasis as a result of environmental and host metabolic factors can contribute to oral diseases,  including dental caries,  periodontitis,  halitosis,  or other medical ailments,  such as diabetes,  cardiovascular diseases,  and cancers. Elaborate studies have shown the toxicity of conventional tobacco product consumption to periodontal health,  albeit with very limited understanding on e-cigarette's effect. The e-cigarette aerosol interaction with the host ensues largely in the oral cavity and lungs,  where the exposure to nicotine and toxic metabolites of the e-liquid components is the highest and can escalate the host susceptibility to infections. Recent reports associate e-cigarette vaping with vascular endothelial dysfunction causing blood-brain barrier damage with higher risk of cerebrovascular diseases. Hence,  it is imperative to elucidate the detrimental effect of e-liquids on the host inflammatory responses,  which is highly challenging and conflicting.The lucrative e-cigarette vaping delivery systems,  available in a variety of flavors and concentrations,  can pose a substantial threat to human health. have shown that e-liquids induce inflammatory responses and alter innate immune defenses in primary airway epithelial cells. The findings of indicated that exposure of C57BL/6 mice to e-cigarette aerosols for 2 weeks can cause impairment of pulmonary bacterial and viral clearance. Accordingly,  in vitro studies can be extrapolated to recognize responses by electronic nicotine delivery system users,  however,  without the clinical evidence of smoking history. So,  to understand the comprehensive health effects of vaping it is essential to conduct clinical research in conjunction with in vitro e-cigarette aerosol-exposed model. This will further help us to associate and understand the impact of vaping on human health by gauging the positive and negative controls.Here,  we report the in vivo effects of e-cigarette aerosol and its influence on human salivary microbiome and immune health. Furthermore,  we evaluate in vitro the influence of e-cigarette aerosols on infection efficiency of oral pathogens in pre-cancerous and cancer cell lines using a novel e-cigarette aerosol-generating machine and pro-inflammatory immune mediators.

Our overall goal was to determine the bacterial diversity on the surface of the tongue dorsum as part of our ongoing efforts to identify all cultivable and not-yet-cultivated species of the oral cavity. Tongue dorsum scrapings were analyzed from healthy subjects with no complaints of halitosis and subjects with halitosis,  defined as an organoleptic score of 2 or more and volatile sulfur compound levels greater than 200 ppb. 16S rRNA genes from DNA isolated from tongue dorsum scrapings were amplified by PCR with universally conserved bacterial primers and cloned into Escherichia coli. Typically,  50 to 100 clones were analyzed from each subject. Fifty-one strains isolated from the tongue dorsa of healthy subjects were also analyzed. Partial sequences of approximately 500 bases of cloned inserts from the 16S rRNA genes of isolates were compared with sequences of known species or phylotypes to determine species identity or closest relatives. Nearly complete sequences of about 1, 500 bases were obtained for potentially novel species or phylotypes. In an analysis of approximately 750 clones,  92 different bacterial species were identified. About half of the clones were identified as phylotypes,  of which 29 were novel to the tongue microbiota. Fifty-one of the 92 species or phylotypes were detected in more than one subject. Those species most associated with healthy subjects were Streptococcus salivarius,  Rothia mucilaginosa,  and an uncharacterized species of Eubacterium (strain FTB41). Streptococcus salivarius was the predominant species in healthy subjects,  as it represented 12 to 40% of the total clones analyzed from each healthy subject.

For example,  Helicobacter hepaticus was discovered in 1992 as a cause of chronic active hepatitis that progressed to hepatocellular carcinoma in A/JCr mice. Formation of colon cancer in genetically altered mice is promoted by infection with H. hepaticus,  either by itself or in conjunction with Helicobacter bilis. Chronic infection with Citrobacter rodentium,  a mouse pathogen that is genetically similar to enteropathogenic Escherichia coli,  can result in colon cancer. H. hepaticus was shown to promote cancer formation in the mammary gland of mice."

        "context": "Despite a relatively small amount of bacterial sequence data recovered from our samples (primarily due to the high level of human DNA contamination),  a combination of comparative and de novo assembly approaches was able to reconstruct large genomic segments from several dominant organisms in our samples,  thereby allowing a better reconstruction of an unculturable TM7 organism (in conjunction with data generated through single cell genomic approaches),  and providing a glimpse at the genomic variation (and possible association with virulence) within Actinomyces genomes. Better assemblies were possible in samples that were sequenced more deeply (e.g.,  sample H1),  indicating the need to sequence the oral environment more deeply than has been done in this study. Furthermore,  assembly quality roughly correlated with disease status,  partly confirming our observation (based on 16S rDNA data) that diseased samples had a higher microbial diversity."

The presence of pathogens within this community can lead to the clinical manifestations of periodontal disease.",
        "context": "Here we have shown that functional information derived from whole-metagenomic data provides a valuable complement to the taxonomic data and allows us to develop a novel theory of periodontal disease. The healthy state is highly regulated by the host immune system and interactions between community members to maintain a community dominated by few 'good' microbes,  usually gram-positive Actinobacteria or Streptococci. The transition to periodontal disease involves a disruption of the host-microbiome interactions that results in a more even community structure composed by a broad range of organisms that can thrive in the oral environment. The presence of pathogens within this community can lead to the clinical manifestations of periodontal disease,  which in turn can lead to additional changes in the community due to the increased availability of nutrients released by the damaged tissue. As a result,  the periodontal disease microbiome eventually settles into a state characterized by a diverse population of microbes adapted to a parasitic lifestyle made possible by the disrupted host homeostasis."

This disruption could be caused at the one hand by a change in the local environment induced by factors such as diet,  oral hygiene or smoking,  and on the other hand by synergistic interactions in distinct ecologies of different microbial communities within the biofilm,  which result in changes in the virulence and pathogenicity of otherwise nonor low-pathogenic species (Human Microbiome Project Consortium 2012,  Segata et al. 2012)."

Secondly, the PICRUSt analyses also indicated that oral microbiota in RAS had the significantly more abundant genes involving in cell motility, cellular processes and signaling, as well as environment adaptation. Thirdly, oral microbiota of RAS had the significantly lower basal metabolism, such as carbohydrate metabolism, biosynthesis of other secondary metabolites, cell growth and death, energy metabolism, amino acid metabolism, and nucleotide metabolism."

        "question": "What role does microbial factor play in recurrent aphthous stomatitis (RAS)?",
        "answer": "Microbial factor is a causative agent of RAS, and imbalances of oral microbiota are frequently accompanied with RAS.",
        "context": "It has been well known that microbial factor is a causative agent of RAS. Therefore, imbalances of oral microbiota are frequently accompanied with RAS. The present study also characterized the oral microbiome of RAS."

        "question": "What specific findings were observed in relation to certain bacterial phylotypes and RAS?",
        "answer": "Certain bacterial phylotypes such as Haemophilus, Prevotella, Vibrio, and Actinobacillus were significantly altered in young females with RAS.",
        "context": "In young females, several associations between RAS and oral microbiota were consistent with the former studies. It was well known that Streptococcal species and Helicobacter pylori were the main RAS-related pathogenic bacteria. Due to the limit of 16S rRNA Miseq sequencing, Helicobacter pylori was not identified in this study. In addition, Streptococcal species were not found being the significantly altered microbial phylotypes. Indeed, Streptococcal species and Helicobacter pylori have been proposed to provoke development of RAS, but there is no evidence to prove that they are related with RAS in oral microbiome. The reason might be that Streptococcal species were initial factors perturbing the global oral microbiota at the early stage of inflammation in RAS but their proportion were lower to normal levels after oral microbiota imbalances."

        "question": "What is the connection between phylogeny and functions of oral microbial community?",
        "answer": "Phylogeny and function of oral microbial community are connected. The altered oral microbiota could determine the potential functional of oral microbiota in the samples.",
        "context": "Phylogeny and functions of gut microbiota are connected. The altered oral microbiota could determine the potential functional of oral microbiota in the samples. RAS is a system disease with pathogenesis of infection, immunity and metabolism disorders. The study inferred that oral microbiota could contribute to RAS pathogenesis due to the different function pathways of oral microbiota in the infectious diseases and basal metabolisms."
